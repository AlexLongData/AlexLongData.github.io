    <h3>Week 1</h3>

    <p>Here are three charts from Rapidcharts to get the page started.</p>

    <div class="chart" id="chart1">
        <script>
            var myChart1 = "charts/chart1_covidUKRegions.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart1', myChart1);
        </script>
    </div>

    <div class="chart" id="chart2">
        <script>
            var myChart2 = "charts/chart2_ukProductivity.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart2', myChart2);
        </script>
    </div>

    <div class="chart" id="chart3">
        <script>
            var myChart3 = "charts/chart3_Football2.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart3', myChart3);
        </script>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <h3>Week 2</h3>

    <p>The first chart beneath has been created using a given API. The second chart was created using data from the same API, but the data file is stored locally in the GitHub repository.</p>

    <div class="chart" id="chart4">
        <script>
            var myChart4 = "charts/chart4_mycoviddata_api.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart4', myChart4);
        </script>
    </div>

    <div class="chart" id="chart5">
        <script>
            var myChart5 = "charts/chart5_mycoviddata_local.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart5', myChart5);
        </script>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <h3>Week 3</h3>

    <p>
        The following two charts have been somewhat manually adjusted. For the first chart, Bloomberg revenue
        estimates were added to an existing csv from Statista. The second chart has data which was entered manually.
    </p>

    <div class="chart" id="chart6">
        <script>
            var myChart6 = "charts/chart6_googlerevenue.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart6', myChart6);
        </script>

        </script>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <h3>Week 4</h3>

    <p>Here are two charts which have been created using two different APIs.</p>

    <div class="chart" id="chart8">
        <script>
            var myChart8 = "charts/chart8_oilprices.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart8', myChart8);
        </script>
    </div>

    <div class="chart" id="chart9">
        <script>
            var myChart9 = "charts/chart9_gbcpi.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart9', myChart9);
        </script>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <h3>Week 5</h3>

    <p>These charts, similarly to the previous charts, gets data from an API. But in this case, a loop is used to download the data. Click <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/167JevkgJbdjW6MMGWwHZPeNBQsWs-nHj?usp=sharing">here</a> to see the loop code.</p>

    <div class="chart" id="chart10">
        <script>
            var myChart10 = "charts/chart10_usacpi_stlouisfed.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart10', myChart10);
        </script>
    </div>

    <div class="chart" id="chart11">
        <script>
            var myChart11 = "charts/chart11_10ytreasuries.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart11', myChart11);
        </script>
    </div>

    <div class="chart" id="chart12">
        <script>
            var myChart12 = "charts/chart12_usaunrate.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart12', myChart12);
        </script>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <h3>Week 7</h3>

    <p>This chart is charting data which has been collected using a scraper. The scraper can be found <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1waDK5wD7K1lOBNuumAzLtMFLb_E1oiAs?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

    <div class="chart" id="chart13">
        <script>
            var myChart13 = "charts/chart13_2013top10mrkcap.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart13', myChart13);
        </script>
    </div>

    <h3>Week 8</h3>

    <p>
        During the Health and Economics talk at the Festival of Economics, questions arose about the
        policy decisions which had taken place in the UK. One being the lockdown, and discussion was held about how
        costly this was for the economy. One of the panelists, brought up the example between Sweden and Denmark.
        Sweden decided not to impose a lockdown, whereas, Denmark did. This chart shows that, even without a lockdown, the pandemic has been very expensive for economies with
        consumer spending dropping. This is likely due to consumers acting rationally. In this case, this involves
        consumers reducing the chance of exposure to the virus. So although, a lockdown wasn't imposed in Sweden, consumers'
        rationality led to them staying at home. Therefore, the lack of economic activity is unlikely to be solely
        caused by a lockdown. This is, of course, speculation, trying to quantify rationality is a bit tricky.
    </p>

    <div class="chart" id="chart14">
        <script>
            var myChart14 = "charts/chart14_consumerspending_swe_vs_den.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart14', myChart14);
        </script>

    <h3>Week 9</h3>

    <p>
        This chart contains data from the St. Louis Fed and the Nasdaq.
        The data has been standardised. This is because without standardisation the analysis provides
        nothing insightful as the SnP composite can continually grow upwards whereas yields behave differently.
        This chart shows that as yields decrease, the SnP composite tends to increase in value. This makes sense as investors
        are rationally and will allocate their assets where returns are. Note: values appear negative but this is due to 
        the standardisation process. R-squared is 0.46, and therefore, roughly half of the observed variation can be
        described by the models inputs. In other words, half of the time, that the movements in these two variables
        are correlated, it is due one of them moving.
    </p>

    <div class="chart" id="chart15">
        <script>
            var myChart15 = "charts/chart15_regression_10y_snpcomp.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart15', myChart15);

    <h3>Week 10</h3>

    <p>These two charts contain an interactive element.</p>

    <div class="chart" id="chart16">
        <script>
            var myChart16 = "charts/chart16_avghouseprice.json";
